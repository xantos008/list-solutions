# Refactoring Code

### Please Refactor the code in `/src/App.tsx`.

### How should it works?
The list of items should be filled with some random HEAVILY calculated content. On press "Add more" some additional items should be added to the existing list (E.g. + 20 items on every click). 

### What you can do?

**You can do whatever you want. For example create new components, helpers, hooks, etc.**

**To fix the code in `/src/App.tsx` as you think it should look like. Don't mind about the styles.**





## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
